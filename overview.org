* Actors

Within the ECi Order Placement system a dealer typically takes on the role of
/Buyer/. A vendor or supplier (typical readers of this document) take the role of
/Seller/. A /Consumer/ is the dealer's customer, though there are nuances we will
not attempt to explain right now.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file ./images/buyer-usecases.puml.png :exports results
@startuml sequence-buyer2seller.png
Buyer -> (Place Order)
Buyer -> (Select Shipment Method)
Buyer -> (Stock, Cost, Date)
@enduml
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file ./images/seller-usecases.puml.png :exports results
@startuml sequence-buyer2seller.png
Seller -> (Invoice Shipment)
Seller -> (Announce Shipment)
Seller -> (Accept Order)
Seller -> (Reject Order)
@enduml
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file ./images/consumer-usecases.puml.png :exports results
@startuml sequence-buyer2seller.png
Consumer -> (Todo)
@enduml
#+END_SRC

* Endpoints

There are six endpoints, three provided by the Seller's system

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file ./images/sequence-buyer2seller.puml.png :exports results
@startuml sequence-buyer2seller.png
Buyer -> Seller: [ POST ] stock
Buyer -> Seller: [ GET ] shipment methods
Buyer -> Seller: [ POST ] order
@enduml
#+END_SRC

And three provided by the Buyer's system:

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file ./images/sequence-seller2buyer.puml.png :exports results
@startuml sequence-seller2buyer.png
Seller -> Buyer: [ POST ] order<U+0394> | error
Seller -> Buyer: [ POST ] shipment
Seller -> Buyer: [ POST ] invoice
@enduml
#+END_SRC

* Connecting

** HTTPS / TLS

The ECi Order Placement services will always connect using a minimum of TLS 1.2.

** Authentication

*** Buyer -> Seller

The Seller is responsible for providing participating dealers (Buyers) a user name
and password which the ECi system will use to connect to the Seller's system. This
information will be passed to the seller via HTTP Basic Authentication [[http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7617][RFC 7617]].
Stock and Order resources allow for additional non-schema defined information
(opaque) to be supplied by the Buyer and delivered to the Seller.

*** Seller -> Buyer
ECi is responsible for assigning and maintaining an ID and an API key to each of
the Seller systems. This information will be passed to the buyer system via HTTP
Basic Authentication. Stock and Order resources allow for additional non-schema
defined information (opaque) to be supplied by the Seller and delivered to the Buyer.

* Resource Types

There are six resource types exchanged between the Buyer's system and the Seller's system:

#+BEGIN_SRC dot cmdline: -Kdot -Tpng :file ./images/resource-types.dot.png
  digraph {
    stockD [ label="stock&Delta;" ]
    orderD [ label="order&Delta;" ]

    stock -> error;
    stock -> stockD;
    stockD -> order;
    shipment_method -> order;
    order -> error;
    order -> orderD;
    orderD -> shipment;
    orderD -> invoice;
  }
#+END_SRC

Not all Seller systems support resources or endpoints for Shipment Methods, Order\Delta
(accept/reject), or Shipment information. We have chosen to represent resources using
JSON Schema and prefer Seller implementations also choose a JSON representation. The
Buyer's system can be programmed to send and receive resources in other representations,
though this is not part of the standard agreement and will need to be addressed separately.
